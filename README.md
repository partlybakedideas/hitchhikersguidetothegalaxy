# The guide
a project to make the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.

In the book **the hitchiker's guide to the galaxy** by Douglas Adams, Ford Prefect has a mysterious book (that looks like a calculator) called the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. This repo is meant to recreat that.


> the htchhiker's guide to the galaxy is a very unevenly edited book and contains many passages that simply seemed like a good idea to the editors at the time
-book 1 chapter 21


How it will work
===
To start, we are going to make a bunch dot.txt files, load them up on a raspberry pi zero. It will look very makeshift, and it will say "DON'T PANIC" in large, friendly letters.
