# *The Guide* contributing guide

Do you want to make a article for *the guide*? if yes :+1:, then you came to the right place!

We have two options to contributing. One for writing down *the guide*'s existing articles (from the book) or make your own.

  <summary>Existing</summary>

  Write it down! If you want, you could go and change it a *wee* bit, but the same rules apply as making your own.

  <summary>Make your own</summary>
  Honestly, just write it down!
  But there are rules.
 
 * No cusing.
 
 * It has to sound sorta science -ish.
 
 * Write something appropriate for anyone.
