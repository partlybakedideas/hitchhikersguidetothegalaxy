There is an art, or rather, a knack for flying.

The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.

Pick a nice day, and try it.

The first part is easy.

All it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight, and the willingness not to mind that its going to hurt. That is, it going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground.

Most people fail to miss the ground, and if they are really trying properly, the likelihood is that they will miss it fairly hard.

Clearly, it is the secound part, the missing, that presents its difficulties.

One problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally. Its no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you won't. You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something else when your halfway there, so that you are no longer thinking about falling, or about the ground, or about how muchits going to hurt if you fail to miss it.

It is notoriously difficult to prise your attention away from these three things during the split secound you have at your disposal. Hence most people's failure, and their eventual disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport. 

If, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a bomb going off in your vicinity, or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely and remain bobing just a few inches above it in what might seem to be a slightly foolish manner.

This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration.

Bob and float, float and bob.

Ignore all considerations of your own weight and simply let yourself waft higher.

Do not listen to what anubody says to you at this point because they are unlikely to say anything helpful.

They are most likely to say something along the lines of, "*Good god, you can't possibly be flying!*"

It is vitably important not to believe them or they will suddenly be right.

Waft higher and higher.

Try a few swoops, gentle ones at first, then drift above the treetops breathing regularly.

**Do not wave at anybody.**

When you have done this a few times you will find the moment of distraction rapidly becoming easier and easier to achieve

You will learn all sorts of things about how to control your flight, your speed, your manoeuvrability, and the trick usually lies in not thinking about whatever you want to do, but just allowing it to happen anyway.
