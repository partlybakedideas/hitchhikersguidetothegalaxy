There is an art, or rather, a knack for flying.

The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.

Pick a nice day, and try it.

The first part is easy.

All it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight, and the willingness not to mind that its going to hurt. That is, it going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground.

Most people fail to miss the ground, and if they are really trying properly, the likelihood is that they will miss it fairly hard.

Clearly, it is the secound part, the missing, that presents its difficulties.

One problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally. Its no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you won't.
